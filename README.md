BELOW IS A DETAILED SUMMARY

Imagine a world where accessing public WiFi is simple, affordable, and secure. WiZFi, my innovative network service project, brings this vision to life. It's a flexible WiFi billing system that caters to your diverse needs, whether you're a casual user seeking hourly access or a dedicated traveler craving a monthly plan.

WiZFi stands out with its unique approach to user authentication and security. Forget about shared passwords and unauthorized access! Every user receives a dynamically generated password that expires based on their chosen billing plan. This not only prevents password sharing but also ensures fair usage and timely payments.

But WiZFi doesn't stop there. To combat hotspot sharing and freeloading, the system actively monitors user activity. If a user attempts to share their connection, the system intelligently terminates their access, protecting your revenue and ensuring everyone plays fair.

Convenience is key too. WiZFi offers multiple billing options, from quick hourly bursts to longer daily and monthly plans. This caters to every user's needs, whether you're checking your emails, streaming a movie, or staying connected for an extended period.

Beyond security and flexibility, WiZFi prioritizes user experience. You won't be burdened with remembering complex passwords or enduring frequent login hassles. The system is designed to be seamless and intuitive, letting you enjoy instant internet access with just a few clicks.

WiZFi is more than just a WiFi billing system; it's a game-changer. It fosters a secure, fair, and convenient internet experience for both users and network providers. Join the WiZFi revolution and experience the future of public WiFi access.
